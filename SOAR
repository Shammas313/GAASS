Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) technology helps coordinate, execute and automate tasks between various people and tools all within a single platform. This allows organizations to not only quickly respond to cybersecurity attacks but also observe, understand and prevent future incidents, thus improving their overall security posture.

A comprehensive SOAR product, as defined by Gartner, is designed to operate under three primary software capabilities: threat and vulnerability management, security incident response, and security operations automation.

Threat and vulnerability management (orchestration) covers technologies that help amend cyberthreats, while security operations automation (automation) relates to the technologies that enable automation and orchestration within operations.

SOARs ingest alert data, and these alerts then trigger playbooks that automate/orchestrate response workflows or tasks. Then, using a combination of human and machine learning, organizations are able to analyze this diverse data in order to comprehend and prioritize automated incident response actions to any future threats, thus creating a more efficient and effective approach to handling cybersecurity and improving security operations.
