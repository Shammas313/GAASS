Many define SOAR and SIEM as similar products since both detect security issues and collect data regarding the nature of the problem. They also deal with notifications that security personnel can use to address concerns. However, there are significant differences between them.

SOAR collects data and alerts security teams using a centralized platform similar to SIEM, but SIEM only sends alerts to security analysts. SOAR security, however, adds in automation and response to the investigation path by using automated playbooks or workflows and artificial intelligence (AI) to learn pattern behaviors, thus enabling it to predict similar threats before they happen. Because SOARs, such as Cortex XSOAR, typically ingest alerts from sources that SIEMs do not cover - for example vulnerability scan findings, cloud security alerts, and IoT device alerts - it's easier to deduplicate alerts and in fact, this is a typical use case for SOAR and SIEM integrations. This reduces the amount of time it takes to manually handle alerts, making it easier for IT security staff to detect and address threats.
